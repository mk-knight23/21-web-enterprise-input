# Architecture: 26-data-entry-form

## Overview

A high-precision enterprise data management portal. It features a React 19 frontend designed as a "Precision Entry HUD," enabling secure, sanitized, and efficient record orchestration for corporate database environments.

## Core Logic

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Integrated state management for tracking record entry status, validation levels, and database sync heartbeat.
