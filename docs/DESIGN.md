# Design System: 26-data-entry-form

## Visual Philosophy

The design follows a **Precision Engineering / Enterprise Port** aesthetic. It uses a "Clean Slate" foundation with "Sanitized Indigo" (#4f46e5) accents, focusing on transactional clarity, secure boundaries, and informational precision.

## Design Patterns

- **Precision Sidebar**: Fixed, information-heavy navigation (W-400px) with detailed status telemetry and security badges.
- **Input Glow**: High-fidelity focus states (Indigo-600) with subtle internal shadows to signify an active, sanitized entry state.
- **Commit Surface**: Heavy, slate-900 action buttons with kinetic success transitions (Emerald-500) and shadow depth.
- **Work Status Panel**: Informational grid (10px uppercase tracking) for real-time workflow telemetry.

## Color Palette

- **Slate Foundation**: Background and borders (#f8fafc / #e2e8f0)
- **Enterprise Indigo**: Primary Action & Branding (#4f46e5)
- **Safety Emerald**: Success & Operational indicators (#10b981)
- **Neutral Text**: Highly legible slate hierarchy (Slate-900 to Slate-400)

## Interaction Design

- **Sync Pulse**: Atomic rotation on the database icon during record commitment to simulate real-time API persistence.
- **HUD Reveal**: 500ms slide-fade transitions for sidebar status modules.
- **Field Kinetics**: Group-hover color transitions for icons to improve focus alignment during rapid data entry.
